       Given a set of two numbers, a useful thing to know about them is whether or not they have a common factor.  For relatively small numbers this is often done by inspection, however it becomes more difficult the larger the numbers get.  Luckily, Euclid developed an algorithm around $300$ BC that is still widely used today to determine the greatest common divisor (henceforth called the “gcd”).  This algorithm uses the proposition that the gcd of two numbers is also the gcd of their differences.
       Let $a=bq+r$, then find a number u which divides both a and b (so that $a = su$ and $b = tu$), then u also divides r since $r = a - bq = su – qtu = (s – qt)u$    (Weisstein)
       The Euclidean Algorithm shows up in many topics of mathematics, which include, but are not limited to: reduction of fractions, Chinese Remainder Theorem, continued fractions, and cryptography.  Though the algorithm may seem simple, it is instrumental in the strength of cryptographic protocols, which are important in today’s technological society.  The use of the algorithm has grown exponentially with the introduction of computers.  Modern computing power has greatly increased the speed and efficiency of the algorithm.  In a matter of seconds, with an intelligently coded program, the gcd of $1000$-digit numbers can be determined.  Mathematicians are now able to work with numbers that were once thought impossible.      
	  It would make sense that a set of two numbers with a greatest factor of $1$ (i.e., the two numbers are coprime) would require the most iterations of the algorithm.  Upon further inspection of data, it becomes apparent that the pair of numbers in any given range requiring the most iterations of the algorithm is a pair of Fibonacci numbers.  The Fibonacci numbers are a special sequence of numbers that start at $0$ and $1$ and continue by adding the previous two numbers to produce the next, with the ratio between those two numbers being the golden ratio.  
$\phi = \frac{ 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$
       The sequence shows up many places in mathematics and holds several special properties.  For instance, the gcd of two Fibonacci numbers is a Fibonacci number itself and is located at the index of the gcd of the two indices. 
\begin{equation} 
gcd(F_{exp}n,F_{exp}m) = F_{exp}gcd(n,m)
\end{equation}
       This theorem provides an interesting result that two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are always coprime as their greatest common divisor will be located at the greatest common divisor of their indices.  Since their indices are consecutive numbers and any two consecutive numbers are coprime, the greatest common divisor will lie at F_{exp}$1$ = $1$.  Thus, the larger the numbers get, the further along in the Fibonacci sequence they are, and the most steps it will take to return back to the first index of the sequence.
       Though the Fibonacci numbers provide the worst case scenario, they are not necessarily outliers.  According to the following theorem, it is possible to work the Euclidean algorithm in reverse in order to obtain a pair of numbers for every possible number of iterations.  
       Given any natural number k, there is a unique set of a,b such that e(a,b)=k, where e(a,b) is the number of iterations of the Euclidean Algorithm.   (Epasinghe)
